# Password Shamer

Shaming bad password requirements and practices everywhere.

## Setup

This project uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This project uses a pretty minimal setup.

### Styles
All S/CSS is within the `assets/sass` folder.

### Shamed Data

All of the data for the shamed entities is located in `data/list.toml`. I've purposefully
kept these in alphabetical order - please maintain that convention.

## Contributing

You're welcome to submit a pull request to update the list of the shamed.
